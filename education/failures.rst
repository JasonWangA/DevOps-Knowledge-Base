General issues with poor SCM
----------------------------

* Approved changes not incorporated
* "Minor" changes cause major problems
* Delayed or lag time in performance
* Suppliers deliver non-compliant products
* Unable to identify installed software versions
* Delivered products do not meet performance requirements
* Difficulty maintaining products
* Like-models with different configurations
* Constant changes without proper documentation
* Changes do not match current product/system configuration
* The latest version of engineering drawings cannot be found
* The wrong versions of the configuration items are being baselined
* A required change is implemented in the wrong version of the product
* The wrong version of the product/source code was tested or deployed
* The user is given documentation that doesn't support the version of the product they've received
* Cost increase in overall maintenance and operation
* un-ending blaming of “who’s responsible for the failure” or who did not follow the procedures
